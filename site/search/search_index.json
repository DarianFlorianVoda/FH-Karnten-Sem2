It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.</p>"},{"location":"page1.html","title":"Numpy","text":"<p>NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open source Python library that\u2019s used in almost every field of science and engineering. It\u2019s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it\u2019s at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems. NumPy users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development. The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.</p> <p>The NumPy library contains multidimensional array and matrix data structures (you\u2019ll find more information about this in later sections). It provides ndarray, a homogeneous n-dimensional array object, with methods to efficiently operate on it. NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.</p>"},{"location":"page2.html","title":"Students","text":"<p>Students are the backbone of our society, as they are the future leaders, innovators, and change-makers of tomorrow. They possess a thirst for knowledge, a drive for success, and an unwavering determination to make a difference in the world.</p> <p>Whether they are in elementary school, high school, or pursuing higher education, students are constantly learning and growing. They are exposed to a wealth of information and opportunities that help shape their views and perspectives.</p> <p>Students are also a diverse group, coming from all walks of life, cultures, and backgrounds. They bring unique experiences and perspectives to the table, which enriches the learning experience for everyone.</p> <p>Moreover, students are not just academic learners. They are also social beings who form meaningful relationships with their peers, teachers, and mentors. They develop leadership skills, teamwork, and empathy through their interactions with others.</p> <p>Despite the challenges and obstacles that students face, such as academic pressure, social issues, and personal struggles, they continue to persevere and push forward. They are resilient and adaptable, capable of overcoming any obstacle that comes their way.</p> <p>In short, students are a remarkable group of individuals who inspire us all with their curiosity, creativity, and determination. As educators, mentors, and role models, it is our duty to support and guide them on their journey towards success.</p>"},{"location":"page3.html","title":"FH","text":"<p>Fachhochschule K\u00e4rnten, also known as Carinthia University of Applied Sciences, is a leading institution of higher education located in the beautiful Austrian state of Carinthia.
